Assumptions

When you say "develop a process for continually polling/
collectng available dataset(s)" I took that as meaning
choose a dataset (or multiple if you want) to collect
data and then visualize that data. I found this to be
more interesting than the alternative of polling which
datasets are available and vizualizing that data.
